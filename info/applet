About applet..

I haven't yet automated its production.

First, to get around security permissions of applets,
  i had to disable:  awteventlistener hook, and setproperty(swing.aatext)

Second, in jar file, must bundle all dependencies:
  - compiled code from both src/ adn test/
  - because demo ui is build with the idea builder, includes also idea classes
     and jgoodies forms jar
  - and antlr-runtime jar
